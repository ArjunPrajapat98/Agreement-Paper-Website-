                High&nbsp;user adoption&nbsp;rate = improved recruitment
                agency performance.

              <p>
                We took a deep dive into user data to understand how
                high-performing recruitment agencies increased their
                productivity, growth and ROI after using Agreement Paper.
                The study measured four key success metrics: number of
                users, number of jobs, placement ratio and time-to-place.
                Results were clear: user adoption strongly correlates with
                high performance.
